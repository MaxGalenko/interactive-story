        text: "Deep in the heart of Ravenwood Forest lies an old, abandoned cabin that locals say is cursed. For decades, whispers of a malevolent spirit have circulated among the townsfolk, warning adventurous souls to steer clear. But curiosity often gets the better of the brave, and a group of friends—Evelyn, Mark, Sarah, and Jake—decide to spend a weekend at the cabin to prove the legends wrong. As twilight descends and the shadows stretch long, the friends gather around a flickering campfire, laughter echoing into the darkness. Yet, an uneasy chill in the air reminds them that they’re not alone. As the friends sit around the campfire, the whispers grow louder, intertwining with the rustling leaves. Mark suggests investigating the source, his curiosity igniting an adventurous spark. “It could just be the wind,” Sarah counters, her voice trembling. Evelyn glances at the cabin, its shadowy outline looming ominously. Jake, ever the skeptic, dismisses the fear. “What’s the worst that could happen?”",
